# 1.0.0-alpha
Released 9th January 2026

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.130**

This is a major release, including logic change of proxy, major RakNet performance improvements, new additions and other improvements.

## Changes

The proxy logic changed to server from client.

The logging infrastructure has been migrated to a dedicated worker thread model. Utilizing a ThreadSafeArray as a synchronized message queue, we’ve eliminated the micro-stutters caused by synchronous disk I/O. This ensures the RakNet tick processor maintains its 100 TPS (10ms) target without jitter.

Enhanced the resilience of the UDP Socket Lifecycle. We’ve implemented a robust interception layer for peer-induced connection resets. Instead of allowing socket-level exceptions to propagate and stall the Reactor Pattern, the system now catches upstream disruptions, triggers a graceful session teardown, and clears the RakNet Session ID from the internal registry.

Transitioned all backend ClientSocket instances to non-blocking mode. This prevents the Main Thread from entering a wait-state during stalled Handshakes or delayed MTU Discovery. (still working for it)

Improved configuration system with a new better lightweight one.

Added MOTD, sub MOTD and max players to configuration.
